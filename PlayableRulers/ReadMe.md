### Lore

> Commander, Although I am not fully confident on this, Tygan has made an apparent breakthrough that may potentially allow the resistance to get a new power ally to our cause. And that is to make the Vahlen’s experiments, known as the alien rulers, join us in battle.
>  
> To be honest, I don’t fully trust this plan, not even Vahlen could do it herself. Nevertheless, I would be a fool if we don’t give it a shot. We saw them fight before, if we could get them in our side, then the Elders chances to win will go down to the ground.
